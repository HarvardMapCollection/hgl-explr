Data displayed here was derived from the US Census Bureau 1990 TIGER files. ARC documentation states that: 'Please note, a limited number of 'sliver' tracts were merged with other tracts resulting in a total of 417 census tracts for the Atlanta Region. The Census Bureau published data for 424 tracts including tracts 239.98, 316.97, 316.98, 508.98, 807.97, 807.98 and 912.98. These additional seven tracts resulted from the correction of pre-census mapping errors and fall below the Census Bureau's minimum size standards. Consequently, ARC has incorporated these non-standard tracts into adjacent tracts: 239.98 into 234.05; 316.97 into 313.04; 316.98 into 301.98; 508.98 into 504.06; 807.97 into 801.98; 807.98 into 803.00; and 912.98 into 911.03. Also, due to the fact that the Census Bureau reused the 1980 census tract 303.02 erroneously, ARC instead uses the number 303.08 to correctly refer to this tract and to emphasize that it is a new census tract with no geography in common with 1980 census tract 303.02. In terms of attributes for ARC's 417 census tracts, a number of variables have been extracted from the Census Bureau's Summary Tape Files (STF) for this Theme. In addition, selected demographic data has been included by ARC's Research Division through their annual work on employment and population estimates and forecasts.

The datalayer was derived from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA, now the Nation Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)) Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database (1997). The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas. The Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database represents the third edition of the Digital Chart of the World. The second edition was a limited release item published 1995 09. The product is dual named to show its lineage to the original DCW, published in 1992, while positioning the revised product within a broader emerging-family of VMap products. VMap Level 0 is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data stored on compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM). The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The database contains more than 1,900 megabytes of vector data and is organized into 10 thematic layers. The data includes major road and rail networks, major hydrologic drainage systems, major utility networks (cross-country pipelines and communication lines), all major airports, elevation contours (1000 foot(ft), with 500ft and 250ft supplemental contours), coastlines, international boundaries and populated places.

136,vector_public:TG95DELKALN,"Census Class A Roads, 1995 - Delaware","This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the state of Delaware. Feature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails. According to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, '..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.' This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows: -Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated. -Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics. -Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways. -Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads. -Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category -Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics. -Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",Line,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1995,2005-2009,Delaware,transportation,"ENVELOPE(-75.788658, -75.049926, 39.839007, 38.451013)"

School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials or the Department of Defense provide public educational services for the areas residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in conjunction with the 1970 census. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name. The program identified three possible levels of school districts representing different segments of the school-age population (elementary, intermediate, and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represented all grade levels. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels of a school district may overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, an intermediate school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The 1995 TIGER files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels. The 1995 TIGER files contain a unified school district code for those school districts where all levels are represented in a single district. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. School districts may cut through existing census blocks. In such instances, the Census Bureau created new complete chains and GT polygons. However, the school district boundaries did not create new blocks. The tabulation blocks may contain more than one polygon, and each polygon may have a different school district code. The block parts/polygons allocated to the different school districts do not have separate tabulation block numbers. Thus, a school district in the TIGER files is a representation of the area, not the actual area. The 1995 TIGER files store the school district codes in a set of four, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 9999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district.

The data is a collection of information by Smithsonian Institution volcanologists summarizing 1,509 volcanoes and this version of the data set was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database. The data was adapted from Simkin and Siebert, 1994 'Volcanoes of the World: an Illustrated Catalog of Holocene Volcanoes and their Eruptions' and produced digitally by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. The data include a unique volcano number, volcano name, location, latitude and longitude, summit elevation, volcano type, status, and the time range of the last recorded eruption. More detailed descriptions of the data elements, plus more information on the volcanoes and their eruptions, can be found below and in 'Volcanoes of the World' (Simkin and Siebert, 1994). The book provides a discussion of the many cautions that are so easily stripped away from an electronic database, such as the incomplete and uneven nature of the historical record, even in this century, and the large uncertainties surrounding many older eruption dates. The accuracy of the record varies enormously from one region to another (and one century to another), and the sea-floor volcanism that dominates our planetary magma budget is scarcely represented in this data set. The basic building block of the Smithsonian's volcano database is the 'Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World' (CAVW), a series of regional volcano catalogs published by IAVCEI beginning in 1951. The listings are not intended to be a comprehensive bibliography of references for a particular volcano or region, but represent those references that are cited as the sources of the volcano and eruption data in the CAVW. Several other global compilations have been helpful: among them are IAVCEI data sheets of post-Miocene volcanoes (1975-80), Volcano Letter reports of the U S Geological Survey from 1926-1955 (compiled in Fiske et al., 1987), independent compilations by Latter (1975) and Gushchenko (1979), and a caldera compilation by Newhall and Dzurisin (1988). Major sources of eruption data subsequent to or supplementing the CAVW can be found in a series of annual summaries by Gustav Hantke published between 1939 and 1962 (mostly in the IAVCEI publication Bulletin of Volcanology), and annual eruption compilations by the Volcanological Society of Japan (1960-96) and Smithsonian Institution reports (since 1968) in various formats, compiled in McClelland et al., (1985) and in the Activity Reports section of the Smithsonian Institution, Global Vulcanism website (Venzke et al., 2002-).

Each province has a set of geologic characteristics distinguishing it from surrounding provinces.

Offshore province boundaries are generally defined by the 2000 meter bathymetric contour, but where appropriate are defined by the 4000 meter bathymetric contour. In some cases province boundaries are delineated by political boundaries, as in the case of The United States and Canada, because United States petroleum resources were assessed separately by the U.S. Geological Survey. Provinces are classified as either Priority or Boutique. A priority province is one of 76 non-U.S. geologic provinces defined by the U.S. Geological Survey that together contain 95 percent of the world's non-U.S. known petroleum volume. All priority provinces were analyzed for undiscovered petroleum-resources. A boutique province is a geologic province, other than a priority province, as defined by the U.S. Geological Survey, considered for petroleum-resource assessment. Boutique provinces can be chosen for a variety of geologic, political, technical and geographic reasons. Resource-assessments are conducted by scientists of the U.S Geological Survey's World Petroleum Assessment 2000 by means of a combination of Petroleum System analysis based on available geologic information, and statistical analysis of production and exploration information. Total petroleum systems are defined in provinces considered for assessment analysis. Total petroleum systems are subdivided into Assessment Units.

Statistical entities which may be represented in this datalyer include: Census Designated Place (CDP). Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.

1015,vector_public:TG95ALTRTPY,"Census Tracts, 1995 - Alabama","This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state of Alabama. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). Census tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS).

Where necessary, land use categories were first converted back to the basic land use classification system of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs' (DCA) Minimum Planning Standards. In order for these data to be useful at a regional level, the source documents were then generalized, based on a 50 acre minimum mapping unit, and digitized for relative consistency in detail and edge-matching. As local governments routinely adopt amendments to their future land use maps, it is recommended that interested parties contact individual counties or municipalities directly to get accurate, up-to-date future land use information.

Essential attribute data included here are KGL Name and Census Feature Class Code (CFCC). Predominant features represented in this layer have CFCCs of: D21 (Apartment building or complex); D23 (Trailer court or mobile home park); D51 (Airport or airfield); D61 (Shopping center or major retail center). Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty. The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types A census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category. Landmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted.

1793,vector_public:TG95DCLKALN,"Census Class A Roads, 1995 - District of Columbia","This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the District of Columbia. Feature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails. According to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, '..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.' This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER? data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows: -Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line? files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated. -Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics. -Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways. -Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads. -Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category -Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics. -Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles.

They include partial contours and contours that exist outside the standard HY 1,000-foot contour interval. This layer was derived from the VMAP0 series produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly known as NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), an agency of the United States government. VMAP data set products use the 'vector product format' (vpf). The term 'VMap' is derived from 'Vector Smart Map.' Digital Chart of the World is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data. The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The coverage is is organized into 10 thematic layers which feature a vast number of files organized into libraries. These libraries, or coverages, are geographicially bounded areas, rather than feature-linked coverages. DCW Layers in the Harvard Geospatial Library are feature-based as we have processed the multiple tiles from the VMAP0 libraries into a series of seamless coverages (e.g. aeronautical features appear in a single layer, 'Aeronautical Facilities, Points') which depict a particular feature as it occurs throughout the available geographic coverage areas. Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers.

Wellhead protection areas are important for protecting the recharge area around public water supply (PWS) wells. A Zone II is a wellhead protection area that has been determined by hydrogeologic modeling and approved by the Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Drinking Water Program (DWP). In cases where hydro-geologic modeling studies have not been performed and there is no approved Zone II, an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) is established based on DEP DWP well pumping rates or default values. Certain land uses may be either prohibited or restricted in both approved (Zone II) and interim (IWPA) wellhead protection areas. As stated in 310 CMR 22.02, a Zone II is: 'That area of an aquifer which contributes water to a well under the most severe pumping and recharge conditions that can be realistically anticipated (180 days of pumping at safe yield, with no recharge from precipitation). It is bounded by the groundwater divides which result from pumping the well and by the contact of the aquifer with less permeable materials such as till or bedrock. In some cases, streams or lakes may act as recharge boundaries. In all cases, Zone IIs shall extend up gradient to its point of intersection with prevailing hydrogeologic boundaries (a groundwater flow divide, a contact with till or bedrock , or a recharge boundary).' DEP Zone II and Public Water Supply (PWS) data are closely linked, and DEP Zone II data should be used in association with the DEP Public Water Supply datalayer (PWS_DEP). During the approval process each Zone II is assigned a unique ID (ZII-NUM) by DEP DWP. The DEP Public Water Supply and Zone II datalayers use the ZII-NUM to link protected PWS sources to their approved Zone II. Since some PWS sources within a Zone II may not have been used to delineate that Zone II, the ZII-NUM item can be used to identify the specific wells for which a Zone II was delineated.

Wellhead protection areas are important for protecting the recharge area around public water supply (PWS) wells. A Zone II is a wellhead protection area that has been determined by hydrogeologic modeling and approved by the Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Drinking Water Program (DWP). In cases where hydro-geologic modeling studies have not been performed and there is no approved Zone II, an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) is established based on DEP DWP well pumping rates or default values. Certain land uses may be either prohibited or restricted in both approved (Zone II) and interim (IWPA) wellhead protection areas. In the absence of an approved Zone II, DEP has adopted the Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) as the primary, protected recharge area for PWS groundwater sources. For PWS sources that pump less than 100,000 gallons per day (GPD), the IWPA radius is proportional to the pumping rate in gallons per minute (GPM). Pumping rate is determined by DEP DWP based on one of the following methods, DWP approved pumping rate, metered data or Title 5 flow rate. The formula used for calculating the PWS well point buffer radius in feet is: Radius = ( 32 x pumping rate in GPM ) + 400 The minimum IWPA radius is 400 feet, the maximum (default) radius reached at 100,000 GPD (70 GPM) is 2,640 feet (1/2 mile). In instances where DWP pumping rate information is unavailable DWP approved default radius values are assigned based on PWS well classification. The default radius for community class PWS groundwater sources (GW) is 2,640 feet (804.6 meters). The default radius for non-community sources is 750 feet (228.6 meters) for Non Transient (NTNC) wells and 500 feet (152.4 meters) for Transient (TNC) wells. The DEP GIS Program currently [2003] maintains two statewide IWPA coverages (IWPA and IWPACOM) shared through MassGIS. Both are generated by buffering groundwater sources in the DEP Public Water Supply datalayer (PWS_DEP). The IWPA coverage contains variable width IWPA buffers for BOTH approved community and non community groundwater sources in the DEP PWS datalayer which do not have an approved Zone II.

The datalayer was derived from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA, now the Nation Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)) Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database (1997). The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas. The Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database represents the third edition of the Digital Chart of the World. The second edition was a limited release item published 1995 09. The product is dual named to show its lineage to the original DCW, published in 1992, while positioning the revised product within a broader emerging-family of VMap products. VMap Level 0 is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data stored on compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM).

This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The database contains more than 1,900 megabytes of vector data and is organized into 10 thematic layers. The data includes major road and rail networks, major hydrologic drainage systems, major utility networks (cross-country pipelines and communication lines), all major airports, elevation contours (1000 foot(ft), with 500ft and 250ft supplemental contours), coastlines, international boundaries and populated places.

3470,vector_public:TG95ORLKALN,"Census Class A Roads, 1995 - Oregon","This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the state of Oregon. Feature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails. According to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, '..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.' This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER? data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows: -Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line? files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated. -Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics. -Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways. -Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads. -Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category -Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics. -Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",Line,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1995,2005-2009,Oregon,transportation,"ENVELOPE(-124.562416, -116.540023, 46.235899, 41.991807)"

Ocean features shown here include areas of pack ice, shelf ice and open ocean. The Political/Oceans layers provide a common visual definition of countries rather than a legal one. The legal definition of a coastal country would include offshore ocean areas, while with a graphic depiction, the country ends at the ocean shoreline. Please note that the ocean shoreline is included in the Political/Oceans line coverage only and is not repeated in the Drainage or Hypsography layers. This type of feature organization enables selection of countries as areas and the distinction of the land and water areas of the world. This layer was derived from the VMAP0 series produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly known as NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), an agency of the United States government. VMAP data set products use the 'vector product format' (vpf). The term 'VMap' is derived from 'Vector Smart Map.' Digital Chart of the World is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data. The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The coverage is organized into 10 thematic layers which feature a vast number of files organized into libraries. These libraries, or coverages, are geographicially bounded areas, rather than feature-linked coverages. DCW Layers in the Harvard Geospatial Library are feature-based as we have processed the multiple tiles from the VMAP0 libraries into a series of seamless coverages (e.g. aeronautical features appear in a single layer, 'Aeronautical Facilities, Points') which depict a particular feature as it occurs throughout the available geographic coverage areas. Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers. We have necessarily generalized the discussion of data source material and process steps in the Data Quality section of this metadata document.",Line,National Imagery and Mapping Agency (now National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency),Shapefile,1992,2005-2009,Northern Hemisphere,Oceans,"ENVELOPE(-179.304504, 179.279205, 81.158279, -54.917198)"

3988,vector_public:TG00AZCCD,"UA Census County Subdivisions, 1990 - Arizona","This datalayer displays County Subdivisions for the state of Arizona, based on legal and statistical entities established on January 1, 1990. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their statistical equivalents for the reporting of decennial census data. They include: Census County Divisions; Census Sub-areas; Minor Civil Divisions, and Unorganized Territories. The TIGER/Line files contain a 5-character numeric FIPS code field for county subdivisions. The Census Bureau has established Census County Divisions (CCDs) for Arizona. Legal Entities: Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) MCDs are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states. MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, election districts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the District of Columbia is considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes. - In some states, all or some incorporated places are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/ Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they are located, or the pattern is mixed; some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs. - The MCDs in 12 states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for these MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places. - In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as the statistical equivalent of MCDs for purposes of data presentation. Statistical Entities: Census County Divisions (CCDs) CCDs are areas delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state officials and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. CCDs exist where: 1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs). 2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes. 3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently. 4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public. Census Subareas Census subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas, the statistical equivalent entities for counties in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau cooperatively delineate the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Census subareas were first used in the 1980 census. Unorganized Territories (UTs) The U.S. Census Bureau defines unorganized territories in 10 minor civil division (MCD) states where portions of counties are not included in any legally established MCD or incorporated place. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for census purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation 'unorganized territory' and a county subdivision code. Unorganized territories were first reported in the 1960 census. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions do not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.",Polygon,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1990,2005-2009,Arizona,boundaries,"ENVELOPE(-114.816591, -109.045223, 37.00426, 31.332177)"

4436,vector_public:TG95NELKALN,"Census Class A Roads, 1995 - Nebraska","This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the state of Nebraska. Feature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails. According to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, '..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.' This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER? data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows: -Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line? files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated. -Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics. -Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways. -Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads. -Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category -Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics. -Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles.

Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers.

The region attribute table contains a subset of the fields in the polygon attribute table including SITE_NAME, SCORP_ID, FEE_OWNER, SYMOP1, and a field called REGION-ID used for linking to annotation. Conservation and outdoor recreation facilities owned by federal, state, county, municipal, and nonprofit enterprises are included in this datalayer. Privately owned lands with deeded restrictions are also included, as are lands in the Chapter 61 program. This datalayer can also be linked, through related tables, with the 1988 Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP) inventory, with facilities and activities data for recreation sites. The datalayer is paneled into 351 town coverages and significant updates are ongoing. This update effort, coordinated by MassGIS, uses volunteers from state environmental agencies, regional planning commissions, local watershed associations, town conservation commissions, municipal planning and engineering departments, local and regional nonprofits, and open space plan committees. Although the initial data collection effort for this data layer has been completed, open space changes continually and this data layer is therefore considered to be under development. Additionally, due to the collaborative nature of this data collection effort, the accuracy and completeness of open space data varies across the state's municipalities. Attributes, while comprehensive in scope, may be incomplete for many parcels.

If place names are duplicated within a state, and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ''city'' before ''village''). Statistical entities which may be represented in this datalyer include: Census Designated Place (CDP). Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.

Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers.

5657,vector_public:TG95ALLKALN,"Census Class A Roads, 1995 - Alabama","This datalayer displays the Type A class roads throughout Alabama. Feature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails. According to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, '..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.' This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows: -Primary Highway With Limited Access: Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated. -Primary Road Without Limited Access: This category (A2) includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics. -Secondary and Connecting Road: This category (A3) includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways. -Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road: A road in this category (A4) is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads. -Vehicular Trail: A road in this category(A5) is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category -Road with Special Characteristics: This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics. -Road as Other Thoroughfare: A road in this category (A7) is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",Line,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1995,2005-2009,Alabama,transportation,"ENVELOPE(-88.473091, -84.901815, 35.007663, 30.227182)"

5944,vector_public:TG95DCKGLPY,"Key Geographic Locations, 1995 - District of Columbia","This datalayer displays the Key Geographic Locations (KGLs) throughout the District of Columbia, as definded by the US Census Bureau. Essential attribute data included here are KGL Name and Census Feature Class Code (CFCC). Predominant features represented in this layer have CFCCs of: D21 (Apartment building or complex); D23 (Trailer court or mobile home park); D51 (Airport or airfield); D61 (Shopping center or major retail center). Please note that many other feature types may be present in this layer. Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty. The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types A census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line? files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category. Landmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.",Polygon,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1995,2005-2009,District of Columbia,transportation,"ENVELOPE(-77.0868, -76.947996, 38.96081, 38.823744)"

6147,vector_public:TG95DETRTPY,"Census Tracts, 1990 - Delaware","This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state of Delaware, 1990. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). Census tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",Polygon,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1990,2005-2009,Delaware,boundaries,"ENVELOPE(-75.788758, -75.048413, 39.839007, 38.451013)"

Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places. Each place is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, based on the alphabetical order of the place name within each state. If place names are duplicated within a state, and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ''city'' before ''village''). Statistical entities which may be represented in this datalyer include: Census Designated Place (CDP). Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. Consolidated City. An incorporated place that has combined its governmental functions with a county or subcounty entity but contains one or more other incorporated places that continue to function as local governments within the consolidated government.

Attribute data includes information on the type of fault. A fault, also known as a disjunctive dislocation, is a break in the continuity of a geological formation. Faults can be formed when the earth's crust is compressed or stretched. They vary greatly in size, both in length and depth. Faults are classified according to the type and direction of movement of the rocks on either side of the fault. For example, a fault along which no appreciable movement has occurred is called a joint. Faults with appreciable movement include vertical faults, thrust faults, transcurrent faults, and displacements. ArcAtlas: Our Earth contains global geographic and attribute data at three scales (1:10,000,000 for Europe, 1:20,000,000 for North and South America, Africa and Antarctica 1:25,000,000 for Asia and Australia).

Certain land uses may be either prohibited or restricted in both approved (Zone II) and interim (IWPA) wellhead protection areas. As stated in 310 CMR 22.02, a Zone II is: 'That area of an aquifer which contributes water to a well under the most severe pumping and recharge conditions that can be realistically anticipated (180 days of pumping at safe yield, with no recharge from precipitation). It is bounded by the groundwater divides which result from pumping the well and by the contact of the aquifer with less permeable materials such as till or bedrock. In some cases, streams or lakes may act as recharge boundaries. In all cases, Zone IIs shall extend up gradient to its point of intersection with prevailing hydrogeologic boundaries (a groundwater flow divide, a contact with till or bedrock, or a recharge boundary).' DEP Zone II and Public Water Supply (PWS) data are closely linked, and DEP Zone II data should be used in association with the DEP Public Water Supply datalayer (PWS_DEP). During the approval process each Zone II is assigned a unique ID (ZII-NUM) by DEP DWP. The DEP Public Water Supply and Zone II datalayers use the ZII-NUM to link protected PWS sources to their approved Zone II. Since some PWS sources within a Zone II may not have been used to delineate that Zone II, the ZII-NUM item can be used to identify the specific wells for which a Zone II was delineated. If the DEP Public Water Supply datalayer item ZII-NUM is equal to 0 than that PWS source has no Zone II and should therefore have an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA).",Line,MassGIS (Office : Mass.),Shapefile,2003,2005-2009,Massachusetts,Water-supply,"ENVELOPE(-73.484954, -69.928782, 42.894664, 41.245434)"

6828,vector_public:TG00PRCCD00,"UA Census County Subdivisions, 2000 - Puerto Rico","This datalayer displays County Subdivisions for the Puerto Rico, based on legal and statistical entities established on January 1, 2000. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their statistical equivalents for the reporting of decennial census data. They include: Census County Divisions; Census Sub-areas; Minor Civil Divisions, and Unorganized Territories. The TIGER/Line files contain a 5-character numeric FIPS code field for county subdivisions. The Census Bureau has established Census County Divisions (CCDs) for Puerto Rico. Legal Entities: Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) MCDs are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states. MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, election districts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the District of Columbia is considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes. - In some states, all or some incorporated places are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/ Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they are located, or the pattern is mixed; some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs. - The MCDs in 12 states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for these MCDs in all data products in which it provides data for places. - In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as the statistical equivalent of MCDs for purposes of data presentation. Statistical Entities: Census County Divisions (CCDs) CCDs are areas delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state officials and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. CCDs exist where: 1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs). 2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes. 3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently. 4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public. Census Subareas Census subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas, the statistical equivalent entities for counties in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau cooperatively delineate the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Census subareas were first used in the 1980 census. Unorganized Territories (UTs) The U.S. Census Bureau defines unorganized territories in 10 minor civil division (MCD) states where portions of counties are not included in any legally established MCD or incorporated place. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for census purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation 'unorganized territory' and a county subdivision code. Unorganized territories were first reported in the 1960 census. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions do not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.",Polygon,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,2000,2005-2009,Puerto Rico,boundaries,"ENVELOPE(-67.954186, -65.22111, 18.516014, 17.881241)"

Predominant features represented in this layer have CFCCs of: D21 (Apartment building or complex); D23 (Trailer court or mobile home park); D51 (Airport or airfield); D61 (Shopping center or major retail center). Please note that many other feature types may be present in this layer. Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty. The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types A census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category. Landmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.",Polygon,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1995,2005-2009,Delaware,transportation,"ENVELOPE(-75.764557, -75.346189, 39.829411, 38.682309)"

Though the terms are often used interchangeably, landuse and landcover are not synonymous. Landcover generally refers to the natural or cultivated vegetation, rock, or water covering the land, as well as the developed surface which can be identified on aerial photography. Landuse generally refers to the way that humans use or will use the land, regardless of its apparent landcover. As such, this theme is primarily a landcover database with an extra landuse component which is essential to many of ARC's key agency functions ARC documentation states that: This land use/cover theme was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography at a scale of 1:14,000. The primary sources for this mapping effort were 1999 natural color imagery with four-foot pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc. (formerly DigiAir, Inc.) and 1999 color infrared (CIR) digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs) with one-meter pixel resolution, provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS) through the Georgia GIS Clearinghouse. Using both sources of imagery, landcover polygons were delineated using ARC's previous (1995) landuse/cover GIS database as the principal source of collateral (secondary) data.

Census blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Generally census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas may be large and irregular and contain hundreds of square miles. All territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas have block numbers. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number. Census 2000 Block Numbers. Census 2000 tabulation blocks are numbered uniquely within each state/county/census tract with a four-digit census block number. The U.S. Census Bureau created the tabulation block numbers immediately before beginning its Census 2000 data tabulation process, thereby eliminating block suffixes. The first digit of the tabulation block number identifies the block group. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned a unique 1990 block number with a suffix of 'Z' to identify crews-of-vessels population. For Census 2000, crews-of-vessels population is assigned to the land block identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as associated with the home port of the vessel. Water Blocks. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced a different method for identifying the water areas of census blocks for Census 2000. For the 1990 census, water was not uniquely identified within a census block; instead, all water area internal to a block group was given a single block number ending in '99' (for example, in block group 1, all water was identified as block 199). A suffix was added to each 1990 water block number where the block existed in more than one tabulation entity within its block group. For Census 2000, water area located completely within the boundary of a single land block has the same block number as that land block. Water area that touches more than one land block is assigned a unique block number not associated with any adjacent land block. The U.S. Census Bureau assigned water block numbers beginning with the block group number followed by '999 ' and preceding in descending order. For example, in block group 3, the block numbers assigned to water areas that border multiple land blocks are 3999, 3998, 3997, and so forth. Because some land blocks include water (ponds and small lakes), no conclusions about whether or not a block is all land or all water can be made by looking at the Census 2000 block numbers.

7990,vector_public:TG95DCTRTPY,"Census Tracts, 1990 - District of Columbia","This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the District of Columbia, 1990. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). Census tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",Polygon,"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division",Shapefile,1990,2005-2009,District of Columbia,boundaries,"ENVELOPE(-77.1194, -76.909395, 38.99511, 38.801813)"

Because wells tend to be clustered by the nature of the resource they tap, the Zone IIs protecting those wells will frequently overlap. As a result of this overlap, intersecting Zone IIs are composed of multiple polygons and more than one Zone II can share an individual polygon. The regions data model represents complex area features and supports overlapping or non-contiguous areas. The Zone II data layer uses the regions feature class and topological structure to manage polygonal overlap, by combining all the polygons a Zone II comprises into a single region feature subclass (see the Approved Wellhead Protection Areas (Zone II) (Polygons) layer for component polygons) . Wellhead protection areas are important for protecting the recharge area around public water supply (PWS) wells. A Zone II is a wellhead protection area that has been determined by hydrogeologic modeling and approved by the Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Drinking Water Program (DWP). In cases where hydro-geologic modeling studies have not been performed and there is no approved Zone II, an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) is established based on DEP DWP well pumping rates or default values. Certain land uses may be either prohibited or restricted in both approved (Zone II) and interim (IWPA) wellhead protection areas. As stated in 310 CMR 22.02, a Zone II is: 'That area of an aquifer which contributes water to a well under the most severe pumping and recharge conditions that can be realistically anticipated (180 days of pumping at safe yield, with no recharge from precipitation). It is bounded by the groundwater divides which result from pumping the well and by the contact of the aquifer with less permeable materials such as till or bedrock. In some cases, streams or lakes may act as recharge boundaries. In all cases, Zone IIs shall extend up gradient to its point of intersection with prevailing hydrogeologic boundaries (a groundwater flow divide, a contact with till or bedrock , or a recharge boundary).' DEP Zone II and Public Water Supply (PWS) data are closely linked, and DEP Zone II data should be used in association with the DEP Public Water Supply datalayer (PWS_DEP). During the approval process each Zone II is assigned a unique ID (ZII-NUM) by DEP DWP. The DEP Public Water Supply and Zone II datalayers use the ZII-NUM to link protected PWS sources to their approved Zone II. Since some PWS sources within a Zone II may not have been used to delineate that Zone II, the ZII-NUM item can be used to identify the specific wells for which a Zone II was delineated. If the DEP Public Water Supply datalayer item ZII-NUM is equal to 0 than that PWS source has no Zone II and should therefore have an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA).",Polygon,MassGIS (Office : Mass.),Shapefile,2003,2005-2009,Massachusetts,Water-supply,"ENVELOPE(-73.484954, -69.928782, 42.894664, 41.245434)"

Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places. Each place is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, based on the alphabetical order of the place name within each state. If place names are duplicated within a state, and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ''city'' before ''village''). Statistical entities which may be represented in this datalyer include: Census Designated Place (CDP). Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. Consolidated City. An incorporated place that has combined its governmental functions with a county or subcounty entity but contains one or more other incorporated places that continue to function as local governments within the consolidated government.

8213,vector_public:TG00CAKGL,"UA Census Key Geographic Locations, 2000 - California","This datalayer displays Key Geographic Locations (KGLs), as defined by the US Census Bureau, throughout the state of California. Essential attribute data included are KGL Name and Census Feature Class Code (CFCC). Predominant features represented in this layer include: Airports or airfields; Custodial Facility (hospital, orphanage, Federal penitentiary, state prison); Educational or Religious Institution (convent or monastery, educational institution, religious institution); Multihousehold or Transient Quarters (apartment buildings and complexes, trailer courts or mobile home parks, campground, hotels, motels); Shopping centers or major retail centers; Transportation Terminal (train station, bus or marine terminal). Please note that many other feature types may be present in this layer. Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty. The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types A census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category. Landmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted.

If an area that qualifies as a metropolitan area (MA) has 1 million people or more, two or more primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) may be defined within it. Each PMSA consists of a large urbanized county or cluster of counties that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSAs are established, the larger MA of which they are component parts is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA). CMSAs and PMSAs are established only where local governments favor such designations for a large MA. Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) are metropolitan areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by non-metropolitan counties. Statistical entities which share some relation to the PMSA include: Metropolitan Area (MA). The general concept of a metropolitan area (MA) is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. The MAs and the central cities within an MA are designated and defined by the Federal Office of Management and Budget, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureau-defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000. An MA contains one or more central counties. An MA also may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. Central City. In each metropolitan statistical area and consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the largest place and, in some cases, one or more additional places are designated as ''central cities'' under the official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have central cities.

Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places. Each place is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, based on the alphabetical order of the place name within each state. If place names are duplicated within a state, and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal description (for example, ''city'' before ''village''). Statistical entities which may be represented in this datalyer include: Census Designated Place (CDP). Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.

The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas. The Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database represents the third edition of the Digital Chart of the World. The second edition was a limited release item published 1995 09. The product is dual named to show its lineage to the original DCW, published in 1992, while positioning the revised product within a broader emerging-family of VMap products. VMap Level 0 is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data stored on compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM). The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The database contains more than 1,900 megabytes of vector data and is organized into 10 thematic layers. The data includes major road and rail networks, major hydrologic drainage systems, major utility networks (cross-country pipelines and communication lines), all major airports, elevation contours (1000 foot(ft), with 500ft and 250ft supplemental contours), coastlines, international boundaries and populated places.

Wellhead protection areas are important for protecting the recharge area around public water supply (PWS) wells. A Zone II is a wellhead protection area that has been determined by hydrogeologic modeling and approved by the Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Drinking Water Program (DWP). In cases where hydro-geologic modeling studies have not been performed and there is no approved Zone II, an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) is established based on DEP DWP well pumping rates or default values. Certain land uses may be either prohibited or restricted in both approved (Zone II) and interim (IWPA) wellhead protection areas. In the absence of an approved Zone II, DEP has adopted the Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) as the primary, protected recharge area for PWS groundwater sources. For PWS sources that pump less than 100,000 gallons per day (GPD), the IWPA radius is proportional to the pumping rate in gallons per minute (GPM). Pumping rate is determined by DEP DWP based on one of the following methods, DWP approved pumping rate, metered data or Title 5 flow rate. The formula used for calculating the PWS well point buffer radius in feet is: Radius = ( 32 x pumping rate in GPM ) + 400 The minimum IWPA radius is 400 feet, the maximum (default) radius reached at 100,000 GPD (70 GPM) is 2,640 feet (1/2 mile). In instances where DWP pumping rate information is unavailable DWP approved default radius values are assigned based on PWS well classification. The default radius for community class PWS groundwater sources (GW) is 2,640 feet (804.6 meters). The default radius for non-community sources is 750 feet (228.6 meters) for Non Transient (NTNC) wells and 500 feet (152.4 meters) for Transient (TNC) wells. The DEP GIS Program currently [2003] maintains two statewide IWPA coverages (IWPA and IWPACOM) shared through MassGIS. Both are generated by buffering groundwater sources in the DEP Public Water Supply datalayer (PWS_DEP).
